## Description

This is a CMS style blog! As you can see, some very immature people posted already. I'm not sure what they're doing on my site, but don't take them seriously. You can create an account, don't worry your password is encrypted. You can post, edit and delete your posts, and you can comment on other peoples posts. Keep in mind, most things you can't do on the site without an account, so sign up, we promise we won't sent you any spam mail.

## Installation

First, users must install NPM through the command-line interface. This can be done with the command `npm install` Once installed, they must use the command `npm run dev` if they want to develop. This is able to be accomplished with one command thanks to the presence of a package.json file that contains the packages we need to install. They must also use Insomnia to view the backend working. 

## Usage

You should simply follow this link to the heroku if you want to use the website.
